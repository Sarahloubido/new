# ✅ Deployment Status: READY FOR VERCEL

## 🎉 Issue Resolved

The **"Missing script: vercel-build"** error has been **fixed**!

### ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Root package.json** - Added correct `vercel-build` script:
   ```json
   "vercel-build": "cd client && npm install && npm run build"
   ```

2. **Build Process** - Changed from `npm ci` to `npm install` to avoid cache issues

3. **Vercel Configuration** - Optimized `vercel.json` for monorepo structure

4. **API Entry Point** - Created `api/index.js` for serverless functions
