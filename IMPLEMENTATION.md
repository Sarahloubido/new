# üöÄ Prototype Text Review Tool - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Built

I've successfully created a **complete full-stack prototype text review tool** that addresses all the requirements from your original prompt. Here's what's been implemented:

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

**Backend (Node.js + Express)**
- RESTful API with clean separation of concerns
- Figma API integration for text extraction
- Spreadsheet generation (CSV/Excel) 
- File upload handling with validation
- Screenshot generation and storage

**Frontend (React + TypeScript)**
- Modern, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Step-by-step workflow guidance
- Real-time feedback and error handling
- Drag-and-drop file uploads
- Visual preview of extracted text

## üìä Core Features Implemented

### 1. **Text Extraction from Figma** ‚úÖ
- Connect to Figma files via URL or File ID
- Extract all text nodes with full context
- Capture screenshots for visual reference
- Parse component hierarchy and frame names
- Extract styling information (fonts, sizes, positioning)

### 2. **Spreadsheet Generation** ‚úÖ
- Export to CSV and Excel formats
- Structured data with columns:
  - `id` - Unique node identifier
  - `original_text` - Source text content
  - `edited_text` - Space for edits (empty initially)
  - `frame_name` - Figma frame/page name
  - `component_path` - Component hierarchy
  - `context_notes` - Font, size, position details
  - `image` - Screenshot reference
- Template downloads for testing

### 3. **Text Editing Workflow** ‚úÖ
- Download spreadsheet for offline editing
- Edit in any spreadsheet application (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.)
- Upload edited files back to the system
- Preview changes before applying
- Smart filtering (only processes rows with edits)

### 4. **Update Application** ‚úÖ
- Process uploaded spreadsheets (CSV and Excel)
- Validate and merge changes with original data
- Generate update instructions
- Prepare data for Figma application

### 5. **Visual Interface** ‚úÖ
- Clean, modern design with intuitive workflow
- Step-by-step guidance through the process
- Real-time feedback and progress indicators
- Responsive design for all devices
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels

## üìã Usage Workflow

### For Users:

1. **Extract Text**
   - Enter Figma file URL and access token
   - Click "Extract Text" or use demo data
   - Review extracted elements in the table

2. **Generate Spreadsheet**
   - Choose CSV or Excel format
   - Download the generated file
   - Edit the `edited_text` column as needed

3. **Upload Changes**

   - Preview detected changes
   - Click "Apply Updates"

4. **Get Update Instructions**
   - Receive formatted update data
   - Apply changes manually in Figma (or via plugin)

### For Developers:

1. **Setup**
   ```bash
   npm run setup    # Install all dependencies
   npm run dev      # Start both servers
   ```

2. **Access**
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`

3. **Configuration**
   - Edit `.env` for environment variables
   - Customize Tailwind in `client/tailwind.config.js`
