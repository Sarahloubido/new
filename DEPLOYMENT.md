# Deployment Guide for Vercel - FIXED! ✅

## 🎉 **ISSUE RESOLVED!**

The `react-scripts: command not found` error has been **completely fixed**! Your project is now ready for Vercel deployment.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Merged Dependencies**: Moved all React dependencies from `client/package.json` to root `package.json`
2. **Simplified Structure**: Moved React source files (`src/`, `public/`, `tsconfig.json`) to root directory
3. **Updated Build Process**: Build command now runs `react-scripts build` directly from root
4. **Fixed Server Paths**: Updated server to serve build files from correct location
5. **Cleaned Up**: Removed duplicate client directory structure

## 📁 **New Project Structure:**

```
prototype-text-review-tool/
├── package.json          # Contains ALL dependencies (server + client)
├── vercel.json           # Vercel configuration
├── src/                  # React source code (moved to root)
├── public/               # React public files (moved to root)
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript config (moved to root)
├── build/                # Generated by `npm run build`
├── server/               # Backend API
│   └── index.js
└── DEPLOYMENT.md         # This file
```

## ✅ **Build Test Results:**

```bash
$ npm run build
> prototype-text-review-tool@1.0.0 build
> react-scripts build
